## Inspiration
Our inspiration for BeeFriendly came from the lady from TikTok, Erika Thompson, who rescues misplaced bee hives. The inspiration also came from a shared experience among the team members of finding misplaced bee hives and witnessing people killing them instead of rescuing them.

## What our app does 
BeeFriendly is a web application that allows users to report misplaced bee hives by uploading a picture and location to the app. Our AI model analyzes the image to predict the health status of the beehive. Beekeepers and honey companies can subscribe to the service and receive access to a list of reported bee hives to rescue them and add them to their colonies and take care of them, while benefiting from them. The app also includes an educational section with informative articles and paid workshops suggested and published by beekeepers.

## How we built it
We built BeeFriendly using ExpressJS for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. We also built a computer vision model that predicts the health status of the beehive.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development process, we encountered several challenges that tested our skills and determination. One of the biggest obstacles was the limited time we had to complete the project, which led to extreme tiredness due to lack of sleep. Additionally, we faced difficulties in finding the right balance between functionality and user experience in the app design. Despite these challenges, we learned valuable lessons and were able to overcome them through perseverance and teamwork.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of what we were able to accomplish in a short amount of time. As a team of women, we proved our worth and our skills in technology, development, and AI. We also reached out to a beekeeper to ask for his opinion and he encouraged us to work on it because he found it innovative and interesting. In addition to our accomplishments, we learned a lot along the way. We gained valuable experience in working under pressure and developing new skills and technologies. We are excited to continue learning and thriving in technology.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained valuable experience in working under pressure, managing a project with limited time and resources, and collaborating as a team. We also learned new technologies and techniques, and strengthened our skills in web development and database management. Overall, the project provided us with a great learning opportunity and helped us grow both professionally and personally.

## What's next for BeeFriendly
Our next goal is to add an IoT-based monitoring system for hives, which will help beekeepers manage the health and well-being of their colonies more effectively.

## Repo hierarchy
We have three subfolders : one for the frontent, one for the backend and one for the AI model.
